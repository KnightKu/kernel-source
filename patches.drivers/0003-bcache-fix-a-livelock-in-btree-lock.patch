Subject: [PATCH 3/5] bcache: fix a livelock in btree lock
Patch-mainline: v4.5-rc1
Git-commit: 2ef9ccbfcb90cf84bdba320a571b18b05c41101b
References: bnc#910440

This commit tries to fix a livelock in bcache.  This livelock might
happen when we causes a huge number of cache misses simultaneously.

When we get a cache miss, bcache will execute the following path.

->cached_dev_make_request()
  ->cached_dev_read()
    ->cached_lookup()
      ->bch->btree_map_keys()
        ->btree_root()  <------------------------
          ->bch_btree_map_keys_recurse()        |
            ->cache_lookup_fn()                 |
              ->cached_dev_cache_miss()         |
                ->bch_btree_insert_check_key() -|
                  [If btree->seq is not equal to seq + 1, we should return
                   EINTR and traverse btree again.]

In bch_btree_insert_check_key() function we first need to check upgrade
flag (op->lock == -1), and when this flag is true we need to release
read btree->lock and try to take write btree->lock.  During taking and
releasing this write lock, btree->seq will be monotone increased in
order to prevent other threads modify this in cache miss (see btree.h:74).
But if there are some cache misses caused by some requested, we could
meet a livelock because btree->seq is always changed by others.  Thus no
one can make progress.

This commit will try to take write btree->lock if it encounters a race
when we traverse btree.  Although it sacrifice the scalability but we
can ensure that only one can modify the btree.
