Subject: nvme_fc: Fix crash when nvme controller connection fails.
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
Git-commit: 0b5a7669a457dd503b3d9922e931ecb01843a916
References: bsc#1044640

If a controller connection is attempted (say to a subsystem that
does not exist), the first attempt errors out.  If another connect
is attempted, it crashes.

Issue is the prior controller has yet execute it's final put, thus
its still on lists. However, opts points on it have been cleared, thus
causing the crash if they are referenced.

Fix is to add the missing put after the nvme_uninit_ctrl() call on
the attachment failure.
