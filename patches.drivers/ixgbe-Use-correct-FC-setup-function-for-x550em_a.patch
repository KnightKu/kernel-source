Subject: ixgbe: Use correct FC setup function for x550em_a
Patch-mainline: v4.7-rc1
Git-commit: a0254a70b4f91396ad04b1225dd7c10a680d38ff
References: bsc#1024349 FATE#321240 bsc#1024355 FATE#321241

Somehow the wrong fc_setup function was used for x550em_a, so
correct that. Also set setup_link to NULL as its value is
determined later, just like it is with X550EM_x.
