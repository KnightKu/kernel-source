Subject: bna: use designated initializers
Patch-mainline: v4.10-rc1
Git-commit: 9751362a4fe7ad37115d20344ce6d914a088268d
References: bsc#1019684 FATE#321695

Prepare to mark sensitive kernel structures for randomization by making
sure they're using designated initializers. These were identified during
allyesconfig builds of x86, arm, and arm64, with most initializer fixes
extracted from grsecurity.
