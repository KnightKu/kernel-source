Subject: lpfc: Fix NVME PRLI handling during RSCN
Patch-Mainline: submitted linux-scsi 2017/08/05
References: bsc#1052384

A race condition was found whereby the initiator would receive
the RSCN for a new NVME device before it had a chance to register
its FC4 support with the fabric. Thus, when queried by the initiator,
it would see that the target supported FC-NVME.

Corrected by making the assumption that the target always supports
FC-NVME thus a PRLI is sent. It's ok for the target to reject it.
