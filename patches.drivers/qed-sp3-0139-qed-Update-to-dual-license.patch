Subject: qed*: Update to dual-license
Patch-mainline: v4.11-rc1
Git-commit: e8f1cb507d01205e03f69809af4347ed8ec9db5b
References: bsc#1019695 FATE#321703 bsc#1019699 FATE#321702 bsc#1022604 FATE#321747

Since the submission of the qedr driver, there's inconsistency
in the licensing of the various qed/qede files - some are GPLv2
and some are dual-license.
Since qedr requires dual-license and it's dependent on both,
we're updating the licensing of all qed/qede source files.
