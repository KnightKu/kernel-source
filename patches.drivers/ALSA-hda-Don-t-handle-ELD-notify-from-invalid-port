Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Don't handle ELD notify from invalid port
Git-commit: 4f8e4f3537cafc4de128e6bfdf83baa78bc60eb1
Patch-mainline: 4.6-rc1
References: bsc#1033784

The current Intel HDMI codec driver supports only three fixed ports
from port B to port D.  However, i915 driver may assign a DP on other
ports, e.g. port A, when no eDP is used.  This incompatibility is
caught later at pin_nid_to_pin_index() and results in a warning
message like "HDMI: pin nid 4 not registered" at each time.

This patch filters out such invalid events beforehand, so that the
kernel won't be too grumbling.
