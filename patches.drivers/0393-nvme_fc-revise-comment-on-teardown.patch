Subject: nvme_fc: revise comment on teardown
References: bsc#1037838
Patch-Mainline: submitted to linux-scsi 2017/05/16

Per the recommendation by Sagi on:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-nvme/2017-April/009261.html

An extra reference was pointed out.  There's no issue with the
references, but rather a literal interpretation of what the comment
is saying.

Reword the comment to avoid confusion.
