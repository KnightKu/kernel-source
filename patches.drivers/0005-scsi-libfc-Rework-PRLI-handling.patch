Subject: scsi: libfc: Rework PRLI handling
Git-commit: 386b97b43c0c9e0d878eec7ea1db16af22b036ae
Patch-mainline: v4.10-rc1
References: bsc#1023764

PRLI is only required if the port is acting as an initiator; ports
which support target functionality only do not need to send PRLI.
At the same time the PRLI state is only used if the port initiated
a PRLI transfer; if we received a PRLI request we should _not_
change the state as this would cause our PRLI response to be dropped.
And when we receive a PRLI response we need to check if an image
pair has been established; if not the remote port cannot act as a
target for us and we need to disable target functionality.
