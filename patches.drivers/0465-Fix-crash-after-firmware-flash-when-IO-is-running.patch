Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix crash after firmware flash when IO is running.
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
Git-commit: 569dbe84a3e769009aa4a5d1030d000168889580
References: bsc#1044623

OS crashes after the completion of firmware download.

Failure in posting SCSI SGL buffers because number of SGL buffers
is less than total count. Some of the pending IOs are not completed
by driver. SGL buffers for these IOs are not added back to the list.
Pending IOs are not completed because lpfc_wq_list list is
initialized before completion of pending IOs.

Postpone lpfc_wq_list reinitialization by moving
lpfc_sli4_queue_destroy() after lpfc_hba_down_post().
