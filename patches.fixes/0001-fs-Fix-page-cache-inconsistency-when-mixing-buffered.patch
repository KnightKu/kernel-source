Subject: [PATCH 1/3] fs: Fix page cache inconsistency when mixing buffered and
 AIO DIO
Git-commit: 332391a9935da939319e473b4680e173df75afcf
Patch-mainline: v4.14
References: bsc#1073407 bsc#1069135

Currently when mixing buffered reads and asynchronous direct writes it
is possible to end up with the situation where we have stale data in the
page cache while the new data is already written to disk. This is
permanent until the affected pages are flushed away. Despite the fact
that mixing buffered and direct IO is ill-advised it does pose a thread
for a data integrity, is unexpected and should be fixed.

Fix this by deferring completion of asynchronous direct writes to a
process context in the case that there are mapped pages to be found in
the inode. Later before the completion in dio_complete() invalidate
the pages in question. This ensures that after the completion the pages
in the written area are either unmapped, or populated with up-to-date
data. Also do the same for the iomap case which uses
iomap_dio_complete() instead.

This has a side effect of deferring the completion to a process context
for every AIO DIO that happens on inode that has pages mapped. However
since the consensus is that this is ill-advised practice the performance
implication should not be a problem.

This was based on proposal from Jeff Moyer, thanks!
