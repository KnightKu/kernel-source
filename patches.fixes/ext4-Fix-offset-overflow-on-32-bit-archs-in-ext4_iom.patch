Subject: [PATCH] ext4: Fix offset overflow on 32-bit archs in
 ext4_iomap_begin()
References: bsc#1079747
Patch-mainline: Submitted 20/02/2018

ext4_iomap_begin() has a bug where offset returned in the iomap
structure will be truncated to unsigned long size. On 64-bit
architectures this is fine but on 32-bit architectures obviously not.
Not many places actually use the offset stored in the iomap structure
but one of visible failures is in SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA implementation.
If we create a file like:

dd if=/dev/urandom of=file bs=1k seek=8m count=1

then

lseek64("file", 0x100000000ULL, SEEK_DATA)

wrongly returns 0x100000000 on unfixed kernel while it should return
0x200000000. Avoid the overflow by proper type cast.

Fixes: 545052e9e35a ("ext4: Switch to iomap for SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA")
