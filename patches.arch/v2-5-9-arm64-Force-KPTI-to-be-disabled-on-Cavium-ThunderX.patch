Subject: arm64: Force KPTI to be disabled on Cavium ThunderX
Git-commit: 6dc52b15c4a48052ade2529d639eee401d76e469
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1068032

Cavium ThunderX's erratum 27456 results in a corruption of icache
entries that are loaded from memory that is mapped as non-global
(i.e. ASID-tagged).

As KPTI is based on memory being mapped non-global, let's prevent
it from kicking in if this erratum is detected.
