Subject: [PATCH 088/101] arm64: Add platform selection for BCM2835
Git-commit: 221d1259eed2c25b0dc7ba82a6ddede2cd37c7ac
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: https://github.com/anholt/linux.git
References: FATE#319481

Like ARCH_BCM_IPROC, we replicate the config option under arm64, but
with a much simpler set of selects under it.  Note that an ARCH_BCM
was also required, to get pinctrl/bcm/ to build.
