Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: r8a7791: Correct parent of SSI[0-9] clocks
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.123
Git-commit: 16fe68dcab5702a024d85229ff7e98979cb701a5

[ Upstream commit 16fe68dcab5702a024d85229ff7e98979cb701a5 ]

The SSI-ALL gate clock is located in between the P clock and the
individual SSI[0-9] clocks, hence the former should be listed as their
parent.
