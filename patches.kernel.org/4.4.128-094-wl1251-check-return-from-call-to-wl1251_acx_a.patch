Subject: [PATCH] wl1251: check return from call to wl1251_acx_arp_ip_filter
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.128
Git-commit: ac1181c60822292176ab96912208ec9f9819faf8

[ Upstream commit ac1181c60822292176ab96912208ec9f9819faf8 ]

Currently the less than zero error check on ret is incorrect
as it is checking a far earlier ret assignment rather than the
return from the call to wl1251_acx_arp_ip_filter. Fix this by
adding in the missing assginment.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1164835 ("Logically dead code")

Fixes: 204cc5c44fb6 ("wl1251: implement hardware ARP filtering")
