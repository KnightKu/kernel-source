# KABI rules for symbols and modules
#
# A matching line with PASS allows kabi changes for given modules or symbols,
# FAIL causes an error. The first matching line is considered, the default is
# FAIL if no match is found.
#
# A pattern that contains slashes is matched against the module name a given
# symbol is exported from. The special pattern "vmlinux" matches built-in
# symbols. All other patterns match against symbol names.
