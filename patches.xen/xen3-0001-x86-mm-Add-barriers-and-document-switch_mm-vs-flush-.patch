Subject: [PATCH] xen/x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush
 synchronization
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE-Xen specific
References: bnc#963767, CVE-2016-2069

When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
starting to fill the local TLB.

Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
a couple that were missing.
