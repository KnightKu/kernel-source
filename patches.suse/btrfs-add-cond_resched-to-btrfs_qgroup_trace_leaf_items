Subject: btrfs: add cond_resched to btrfs_qgroup_trace_leaf_items
References: bsc#1028286 bsc#1017461 bsc#1036171
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
Git-commit: cddf3b2cb33e01087e82580a4a7d508f08ba59e4

On an uncontended system, we can end up hitting soft lockups while
doing replace_path.  At the core, and frequently called is
btrfs_qgroup_trace_leaf_items, so it makes sense to add a cond_resched
there.
