Subject: Drivers: hv: hv_balloon: keep locks balanced on add_memory() failure
Git-commit: f3f6eb80872becdbce07f7d2670d3f8ae5119752
References: fate#317533

When add_memory() fails the following BUG is observed:
[  743.646107] hv_balloon: hot_add memory failed error is -17
[  743.679973]
[  743.680930] =====================================
[  743.680930] [ BUG: bad unlock balance detected! ]
[  743.680930] 3.19.0-rc5_bug1131426+ #552 Not tainted
[  743.680930] -------------------------------------
[  743.680930] kworker/0:2/255 is trying to release lock (&dm_device.ha_region_mutex) at:
[  743.680930] [<ffffffff81aae5fe>] mutex_unlock+0xe/0x10
[  743.680930] but there are no more locks to release!

This happens as we don't acquire ha_region_mutex and hot_add_req() expects us
to as it does unconditional mutex_unlock(). Acquire the lock on the error path.

The current char-next branch is broken and this patch fixes
the bug.
