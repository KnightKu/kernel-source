Subject: Drivers: hv: util: make struct hv_do_fcopy match Hyper-V host messages
Git-commit: 31d4ea1a093fcf668d5f95af44b8d41488bdb7ec

An attempt to fix fcopy on i586 (bc5a5b0 Drivers: hv: util: Properly pack the data
for file copy functionality) led to a regression on x86_64 (and actually didn't fix
i586 breakage). Fcopy messages from Hyper-V host come in the following format:

struct do_fcopy_hdr   |   36 bytes
0000                  |    4 bytes
offset                |    8 bytes
size                  |    4 bytes
data                  | 6144 bytes

On x86_64 struct hv_do_fcopy matched this format without ' __attribute__((packed))'
and on i586 adding ' __attribute__((packed))' to it doesn't change anything. Keep
the structure packed and add padding to match re reality. Tested both i586 and x86_64
on Hyper-V Server 2012 R2.
