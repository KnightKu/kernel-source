Subject: [PATCH] Remove BSD-style securelevel sysfs file

Patch-mainline: never, SUSE specific
References: fate#320387

The BSD-style securelevel patches didn't accept by kernel upstream, but
I think those secure boot lock down patches that are still better to align
with the patches in Matthew's linux-mjg59 git tree. This patch removed
securelevel sysfs file then userspace can not pull up securelevel.
