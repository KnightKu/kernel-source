Subject: carl9170: prevent speculative execution
Patch-mainline: submitted on 2018/1/9
References: bsc#1068032 CVE-2017-5753

Since the queue value in function carl9170_op_conf_tx()
seems to be controllable by userspace and later on
conditionally (upon bound check) used to resolve
ar9170_qmap and following ar->edcf, insert an observable
speculation barrier before its usage. This should prevent
observable speculation on that branch and avoid
kernel memory leak.
