Subject: net: mpls: prevent speculative execution
Patch-mainline: submitted on 2018/1/9
References: bsc#1068032 CVE-2017-5753

Since the index value in function mpls_route_input_rcu()
seems to be controllable by userspace and later on
conditionally (upon bound check) used to resolve
platform_label, insert an observable speculation
barrier before its usage. This should prevent
observable speculation on that branch and avoid
kernel memory leak.
