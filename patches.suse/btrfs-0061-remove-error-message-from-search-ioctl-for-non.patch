Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: remove error message from search ioctl for nonexistent
 tree

Let's remove the error message that appears when the tree_id is not
present. This can happen with the quota tree and has been observed in
practice. The applications are supposed to handle -ENOENT and we don't
need to report that in the system log as it's not a fatal error.
