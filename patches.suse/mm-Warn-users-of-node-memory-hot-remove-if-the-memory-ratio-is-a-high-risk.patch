Subject: [PATCH] mm: Warn users of node memory hot-remove if the memory ratio
 is a high risk

References: Memory node hot-remove (fate#316483)
Patch-mainline: Never, upstream developers refusing to acknowledge problem

Warn users of node memory hot-remove is the lowmem:movable ratio is worse
than 1:3.
