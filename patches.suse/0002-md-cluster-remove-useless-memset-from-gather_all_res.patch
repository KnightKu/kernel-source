Subject: [PATCH 2/8] md-cluster: remove useless memset from
 gather_all_resync_info
Patch-mainline: Submitted to linux-raid http://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg55919.html
References: fate#320864

This memset is not needed.  The lvb is already zeroed because
it was recently allocated by lockres_init, which uses kzalloc(),
and read_resync_info() doesn't need it to be zero anyway.
