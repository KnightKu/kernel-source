Subject: [PATCH] livepatch: send a fake signal periodically
Patch-mainline: Not yet, work in progress
References: fate#323487

An administrator may send a fake signal to all remaining blocking tasks
of a running transition by writing to
/sys/kernel/livepatch/<patch>/signal attribute. Let's do it
automatically after 10 seconds. The timeout is chosen deliberately. It
gives the tasks enough time to transition themselves.

Theoretically, sending it once should be more than enough. Better be safe
than sorry, so send it periodically. A new workqueue job could be a
cleaner solution to achieve it, but it could also introduce deadlocks
and cause more headaches with synchronization and cancelling.
