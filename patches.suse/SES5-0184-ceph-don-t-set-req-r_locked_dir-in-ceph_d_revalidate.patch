Subject: ceph: don't set req->r_locked_dir in ceph_d_revalidate
Git-commit: c3f4688a08fd86f1bf8e055724c84b7a40a09733
Patch-mainline: v4.9
References: FATE#322288

This function sets req->r_locked_dir which is supposed to indicate to
ceph_fill_trace that the parent's i_rwsem is locked for write.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the dir will be locked when
d_revalidate is called, so we really don't want ceph_fill_trace to do
any dcache manipulation from this context. Clear req->r_locked_dir since
it's clearly not safe to do that.

What we really want to know with d_revalidate is whether the dentry
still points to the same inode. ceph_fill_trace installs a pointer to
the inode in req->r_target_inode, so we can just compare that to
d_inode(dentry) to see if it's the same one after the lookup.

Also, since we aren't generally interested in the parent here, we can
switch to using a GETATTR to hint that to the MDS, which also means that
we only need to reserve one cap.

Finally, just remove the d_unhashed check. That's really outside the
purview of a filesystem's d_revalidate. If the thing became unhashed
while we're checking it, then that's up to the VFS to handle anyway.
