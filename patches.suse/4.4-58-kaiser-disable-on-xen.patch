Subject: [PATCH] kaiser: disabled on Xen PV
Patch-mainline: Not yet, under development
References: bsc#1068032

Kaiser cannot be used on paravirtualized MMUs (namely reading and writing CR3).
This does not work with KAISER as the CR3 switch from and to user space PGD
would require to map the whole XEN_PV machinery into both.

More importantly, enabling KAISER on Xen PV doesn't make too much sense, as PV
guests use distinct %cr3 values for kernel and user already.
